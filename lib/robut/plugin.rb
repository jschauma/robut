# Robut plugins implement a simple interface to listen for messages
# and optionally respond to them. All plugins include the Robut::Plugin
# module.
module Robut::Plugin

  # Contains methods that will be added directly to a class including
  # Robut::Plugin.
  module ClassMethods

    # Sets up a 'matcher' that will try to match input being sent to
    # this plugin with a regular expression. If the expression
    # matches, +action+ will be performed. +action+ will be passed any
    # captured groups in the regular expression as parameters. For
    # example:
    #
    #     match /^say hello to (\w+)/ do |name| ...
    #
    # The action is run in the context of an instance of a class that
    # includes Robut::Plugin. Like +handle+, an action explicitly
    # returning +true+ will stop the plugin chain from matching any
    # further.
    #
    # Supported options:
    #   :sent_to_me - only try to match this regexp if it contains an @reply to robut.
    #                 This will also strip the @reply from the message we're trying
    #                 to match on, so ^ and $ will still do the right thing.
